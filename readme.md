Final Project - Mohammed Faraz - Brand Portfolio

Welcome to my brand portfolio website!

How I created my website of my brand:
Creating this website design began with UX Design. First, in Adobe XD, I designed my website based on the brand I wanted to start name Graphicus Studios

Challenges and what I learned:

some of the challenges that I faced was with boostrap

I had a hard time using boostrap so for now I went with only css for my website but I am still learning it that I can incorporate it in future

another challenges I would say is time management which I think I managed it very poorly as now I know coding is a length and time consuming process.

The things I learned for previous project and this one is utilizing the online resourse to make things easier I watched some youtube videos and learning some valuable stuff.
